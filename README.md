# NYC_Citibike

# The purpose of the analysis was to present data on NYC citibikes to investors in consideration for a start up bike sharing progeram in Des Moines using Tableau. Multiple worksheets were created, in addition to a story that paints a big picture of the data from the analysis.

### RESULTS:
The check out times by user shown below suggests that the peak times by users is around 5 minutes. That is, 5 minutes is the peak time using the rideshare service as noted below:

The top starting locations appear to center around manhattan region, likely because it is more dense and attractive to tourists:

The peak usage appears to be around 1700, or 5pm:

Males tend to check out more bikes than female riders:

Males tend to be the dominant gender for subscribers and usage on all days of the week compared to females:

The weekends around mid-day appear to be the most popular time to ride where the demand is the greatest:

The highest demand appears to be males, on the weekend hours, during the afternoon time periods

### SUMMARY
* The rideshare program in NYC appears to be effective. There are more subscribers than short term customers, probably based on the density of the population using rideshare services as opposed to vehicles to get around town. Customers may simply represent tourists that do not live in the area and are simply visiting for vacation. Males appear to be using the services more than females :

The disparity between genders is great, suggesting that there are 941,841 more males than there are females considering that riding a bike is and should be a gender neutral service/activity. The most dense riding times are shorter rather than longer and are comprised more so by subscribers who are likely regulars and locals. These tend to be males who use the services the most in the early mornings and in the evenings.

### Recommendations
* One noticeable trend is that subscirbers tend to dominate the amount of time related to trip duration for trips less than < 45 minutes. Given there are a vast amount of subscribers relative to customers, a different trend has emerged for those trips beyond 45 minutes. Customer user types tend to be larger for trips beyond 45 minutes, probably because they are those who are tourists. This can possibly yeild more information for pricing plans to maximize revenue for the ridesharing program where the pricing can be scaled based on usage. Since the customers tend ot be slightly higher for longer rides, the rides can be discounted possibly for trips longer than 45 minutes and factored into an hourly rate. This might entice more people to borrow the bikes longer to see parts of the city and increase the customer usage amount relative to subscribers:

One other recommendation would be to target groups based on age. According to the data, the majority of subscribers tend to be younger, born in the late 80s to early 90s whereas the most customers tend to be born in the late 60s. The younger population rides longer for trips less than 45 minutes; that is the subscribers tend to be younger and show a higher demand for services on trip durations less than 45 minutes compared to customers, who inherently make up the minority. Looking at the graph below, one area for further analysis would be an outreach program to advertise this service to those born after 1990 i.e the milennials whose customer base is a lot less than the subcribers at this age group. This may imply that this age group is more privy to other forms of transporation or services when visiting NYC, or are relatively less interested in a bikeshare program. Further development of the company to include tandem bikes or othertypes of bikes may interest this younger population:
